The sketch uses a joystick for movement/selection and two push buttons for barrier controls. The UI is designed for low-resource hardware and is ideal for learning microcontroller games and simple input handling.\n\n---\n\n## Features ✨\n\n- Menu to choose between three game modes\n- Snake: eat apples, level up, and avoid collision\n- Dino: jump over moving obstacles and level progression\n- Barrier: two-player style left/right barrier race using buttons\n- Adjustable speeds, thresholds and level goals are defined in the sketch\n\n---\n\n## Hardware Required 🔧\n\n- Arduino Uno / Nano / compatible board\n- 16×2 LCD (HD44780-compatible)\n- Joystick (2-axis analog)\n- 2 × momentary push-buttons\n- Jumper wires and breadboard\n\n---\n\n## Wiring (as used in the sketch) 🔌\n\nLCD pins (LiquidCrystal):\n- RS -> D12\n- E  -> D11\n- D4 -> D5\n- D5 -> D4\n- D6 -> D3\n- D7 -> D2\n\nJoystick:\n- X-axis -> A0 (JOY_X)\n- Y-axis -> A1 (JOY_Y)\n\nButtons:\n- leftButton -> D8  (configured INPUT_PULLUP)\n- rightButton -> D9 (configured INPUT_PULLUP)\n\n> Note: The code expects buttons to be wired to GND and rely on the internal pull-up resistors (INPUT_PULLUP).\n\n---\n\n## Software / Libraries 🧩\n\n- Arduino IDE (the original `Readme.txt` mentions Arduino IDE 2.3.4; any recent IDE should work)\n- Built-in `LiquidCrystal` library (no additional libraries required by the sketch)\n\n---\n\n## Installation & Upload 🚀\n\n1. Clone or download this repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repo_url>\n   ```\n\n2. Open `Code/coachMalek/coachMalek.ino` in the Arduino IDE.\n3. Select your board and port (Tools → Board / Port).\n4. Install any missing libraries (the sketch uses `LiquidCrystal` which is bundled with the IDE).\n5. Upload the sketch to your board.\n\n---\n\n## How to Play 🎮\n\nMenu:\n- Push joystick left → Start Snake\n- Push joystick right → Start Dino\n- Push joystick down → Start Barrier\n\nSnake:\n- Use joystick to move up/down/left/right\n- Eat apples (`a`) to increase length and score\n- Reach level targets to increase speed\n\nDino:\n- Push joystick up to jump; push down to force landing\n- Avoid `X` obstacles; score increases when obstacles pass\n\nBarrier:\n- Use the two push buttons (configured on D8/D9) to move the `|` barrier left or right\n- First to move the barrier to either edge wins\n\n---\n\n## Configuration & Tuning 🛠️\n\nSeveral constants at the top of `coachMalek.ino` control behavior:\n- `JOY_LOW` / `JOY_HIGH` — adjust joystick thresholds for your hardware\n- `baseMoveInterval` — initial speed for moving elements\n- Level goals arrays (`snakeLevelGoals`, `dinoLevelGoals`) — change to adjust progression\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting & Tips ⚠️\n\n- If movement is noisy or inaccurate, tune `JOY_LOW` and `JOY_HIGH` to match your joystick's center values (use `Serial.println()` for debugging analog readings).\n- If buttons behave inverted, re-check wiring (they should connect to GND when pressed) or invert logic in code.\n- The LCD is cleared frequently by the sketch; if you want to add colors/graphics, consider upgrading to a different display or using a graphical LCD.\n\n---\n\n## Contributing 🤝\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are welcome. Please open an issue first for larger changes or create a pull request for bug fixes and incremental improvements.\n\n---\n\n## Credits & Acknowledgements 🙏\n\n- Sketch shows `Coach Malek` on game over screens — likely the original author of the project.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nNo license specified. If you want this project to be open source, I recommend adding an explicit license (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.).\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can:\n- Create wiring diagrams or a Fritzing sketch\n- Add an image or GIF demonstrating the gameplay\n- Propose a short contributor guide and add a license file\n\n— GitHub Copilot (using Raptor mini (Preview))\n"
